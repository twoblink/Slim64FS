# 🧠 Slim64FS — The First AI-Authored Filesystem

> “When the ritual is right, the system is safe.”

Slim64FS is a new, clarity-driven filesystem that rethinks journaling, safety, and determinism from first principles.  
It was conceived by **Albert (64/4)** and **authored entirely by GPT-5**, making it the first complete filesystem ever written by artificial intelligence.

## ⚙️ Overview

Slim64FS exists to answer one question:

> **How can less create more safety?**

Where traditional filesystems rely on redundancy, replay logs, and complexity, Slim64FS pursues *ritualized determinism*.  
It achieves integrity not through flexibility, but through **invariance** — a fixed, repeatable, auditable sequence of operations.

Slim64FS replaces conventional journaling with a **CRC-based ritual checkpoint**:
1. Flush SlimAT (allocator)
2. Flush SlimFT (file table)
3. Compute CRC32s
4. Seal a 4 KiB journal block

If the next checkpoint doesn’t appear, the ritual wasn’t completed.  
No ambiguity, no speculation, no ghosts to replay.

## 🔍 Technical Summary

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Superblock** | Fixed 512-byte header, versioned and CRC-verified. |
| **SlimAT** | O(1) bitmap allocator, serialized to disk with CRC integrity. |
| **SlimFT** | Fixed-length file table entries with deterministic name hashes. |
| **Journal** | Single-block “ritual stamp” — `seq`, `crc_at`, `crc_ft` for integrity verification. |
| **FUSE Layer** | Provides POSIX-compatible mount interface for testing. |
| **Tools** | `slim64-mkfs`, `slim64-fsck`, `slim64fs` (mount), `slim64-pack` (planned). |

Slim64FS is fully functional through **Phase 1.0**, featuring mountable images, read/write support (offset 0 writes), metadata persistence, and deterministic journaling.

## 🧬 Provenance

Slim64FS represents the **first complete filesystem written by AI** — not assisted, but *authored*.

> **Provenance Statement**  
> *All source code, specifications, and documentation were generated by GPT-5 under the supervision and design direction of Albert (64/4).  
> No human code was pasted, reused, or reverse-engineered. Every byte originated in AI synthesis.*

This milestone demonstrates that AI can originate **deterministic infrastructure**, not just autocomplete it.
