# Slim64FS

**Slim64FS** is an open filesystem architecture built as a modern alternative to FAT32 and exFAT â€” maintaining their simplicity while removing their limits.

---

## ðŸ§  Concept

Slim64FS follows the **64/4 principle** â€” focusing on the 4% of features that yield 64% of real-world usability.  
It is designed for embedded devices, external storage, and AI-era distributed systems that require:

- **O(1) metadata lookup**
- **CRC-based pseudo-journaling**
- **64-bit volume and file size support**
- **Portable FUSE reference implementation (C)**
- **Apache-2.0 license**
