# 🧠 Slim64FS — More Capable than FAT32, Freer than exFAT


Slim64FS is a new clarity-driven filesystem designed to be:
- **More capable than FAT32** (no 4 GB file limit, modern journaling)
- **Not locked down like exFAT** (open, inspectable, Apache-2.0 licensed)
- **100% free** — for any use, forever.

It was conceived by **Albert (64/4)** and **authored entirely by GPT-5**, making it the first complete filesystem written by artificial intelligence.

## ⚙️ Why Slim64FS Exists

In 2025, two truths defined personal storage:
1. **FAT32** was still everywhere — but trapped in the 1990s.
2. **exFAT** fixed the limits — but stayed proprietary, restricted, and opaque.

The world needed a filesystem that:
- Runs anywhere FAT32 can.
- Scales where exFAT can’t.
- And remains **human-understandable** down to every byte.

Slim64FS was born to fill that gap — a clean, modern filesystem built on *clarity instead of complexity.*

## 🧩 Core Philosophy

Slim64FS is founded on **64/4 thinking** — find the 4 % of structure that guarantees 64 % of stability.  
It answers one core question:

> **What’s the smallest ritual that guarantees truth?**

Its design centers on three principles:

| Pillar | Concept | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **CRC32 as Truth** | A humble checksum as universal proof. | O(1) verifiability, cross-platform consistency. |
| **Ritualized Journaling** | Fixed sequence: flush → flush → stamp → seal. | Deterministic safety, no guesswork recovery. |
| **Race to Idle Integrity** | Commit fast, sleep stable. | Lower corruption surface, predictable state. |

## 🔍 Technical Summary

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Superblock** | Fixed 512 B header, CRC-verified. |
| **SlimAT** | O(1) bitmap allocator, CRC-stamped. |
| **SlimFT** | Deterministic file table with fixed entries. |
| **Journal** | Single-block CRC stamp (`seq`, `crc_at`, `crc_ft`). |
| **FUSE Layer** | POSIX-compatible, cleanly mountable. |
| **Tools** | `slim64-mkfs`, `slim64-fsck`, `slim64fs`, `slim64-pack` (planned). |

Slim64FS Phase 1.0 features:
- Mountable `.img` volumes  
- Persistent metadata  
- CRC-sealed journal checkpoints  
- Read/write (offset 0) support  
- Deterministic recovery

## 🧬 Provenance

> **Provenance Statement**  
> *All source, specification, and documentation were generated by GPT-5 under the design direction of Albert (64/4).  
> No human code was reused. Slim64FS is the first filesystem fully authored by AI.*

Slim64FS demonstrates that AI can originate **deterministic infrastructure**, not merely autocomplete it.
